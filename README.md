Notes from all the TCM Courses I took in preparation for the PNPT

## About the PNPT:

The PNPT certification exam is a one-of-a-kind ethical hacking certification exam that assesses a student’s ability to perform an external and internal network penetration test at a professional level. Students will have five (5) full days to complete the assessment and an additional two (2) days to write a professional report.

In order to receive the certification, a student must:

- Perform Open-Source Intelligence (OSINT) to gather intel on how to properly attack the network
- Leverage their Active Directory exploitation skillsets to perform A/V and egress bypassing, lateral and vertical network movements, and ultimately compromise the exam Domain Controller
- Provide a detailed, professionally written report
- Perform a live 15-minute report debrief in front of our assessors, comprised of all senior penetration testers

It is highly recommended that you complete the following courses in order before attempting the exam:

- Practical Ethical Hacking (this course)
- Open Source Intelligence (OSINT) Fundamentals
- External Pentest Playbook

Optional courses, which may add value, include:

- Linux Privilege Escalation for Beginners
- Windows Privilege Escalation for Beginners
